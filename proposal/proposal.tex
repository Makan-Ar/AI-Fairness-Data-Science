\section{Abstract}
As more machine learning applications are being trusted with making decisions that directly or indirectly affect human lives, the potential lack of fairness or discriminatory decisions have become a growing concern within the machine learning community. 
\section{Introduction}
Machine learning is no longer an esoteric subject. Over the past decade, due to its ease of implementation and reliable high accuracy, it has been adopted in a verity of diverse fields such as finance  \cite{huang2007credit, tsai2008using, galindo2000credit}, crime prediction \cite{brennan2009evaluating} and so on. Decision making in these areas has legal, moral and ethical implications all of which should be considered while aiming for increasing prediction accuracy.
